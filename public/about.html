<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Harshveer Singh Jaspal was born on 7th August 2007 to Manjit Singh Jaspal and mother Baljinder Kaur Jaspal. From the starting, he was a smart boy who got good grades in school and never gave a reason for complain. On the other hand, he was a naughty kid who made a lot of noise at home. The teachers when heard of my nature were so much shocked that they would not believe it. </p>
<p> He had a keen interest in computers and technology. Especially when he saw a computer, he tried to use it like everybody else but went a step further and started to learn about it deeper. This started when he started getting some issues and tried to fix it. He spent days trying to fix a problem and by doing this he became resourceful and started helping relatives and friends in all sorts of technical work.</p>
